A Minecraft mod about superability. The inspiration of AcademyCraft comes from [A Certain Scientific Railgun (とある科学の超電磁砲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun) but the mod content is not limited of the background.

## Regarding Toaru Magic Index

Many people have been asking questions about whether or how much the mod will be related to
the original story _A Certain Magic Index_. Our answer is that although AC is based on the
_Railgun_, which is a spinoff of _Index_, the mod will only focus on the science side of
the story, and thus just loosely related to _Index_.

The mod is dedicated to build an interesting experience evolved around the idea of **superability**,
that's really everything.
